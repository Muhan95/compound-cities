# Compound Cities

A 'compound city' isn't a normative term, but its a fitting description for large cities such as London and New York that have several well-defined, and sometimes semi-autonomous administrative sub-divisions.  Such data are often hard to find, and rarely are they ever organized to highlight the logical hierarchy of such divisions.  For example 

- Greater London
	- Inner London
	- Outer London
