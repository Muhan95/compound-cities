# Compound Cities

While **compound city** isn't a normative term, it is a fitting description for large cities with multipe well-defined and sometimes semi-autonomous administrative sub-divisions.  It is often hard to find data on the boundaries of these sub-divisions, and rarely are such data ever organized to highlight the logical hierarchy of such divisions.  

For example 

- Greater London
	- Inner London
		- Camden
		- Greenwich
		- Hackney
		- Hammersmith and Fulham
		- Islington
		- Kensington and Chelsea
		- Lambeth
		- Lewisham
		- Southwark
		- Tower Hamlets
		- Wandsworth
		- Westminster
		- City of London
	- Outer London
		- Barking and Dagenham
		- Barnet
		- Bexley
		- Brent
		- Bromley
		- Croydon
		- Ealing
		- Enfield
		- Haringey
		- Harrow
		- Havering
		- Hillingdon
		- Hounslow
		- Kingston upon Thames
		- Merton
		- Newham
		- Redbridge
		- Richmond upon Thames
		- Sutton
		- Waltham Forest

This repository aims to collect boundary polygons for such compound cities.  Currently it contains administrative data for:

- New York City
- London
- Tokyo
