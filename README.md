# Compound Cities

A 'compound city' isn't a normative term, but its a fitting description for large cities such as London and New York that have several well-defined, and sometimes semi-autonomous administrative sub-divisions.  Such data are often hard to find, and rarely are they ever organized to highlight the logical hierarchy of such divisions.  

For example 

- Greater London
	- Inner London
		- Camden
    - Greenwich
    - Hackney
    - Hammersmith and Fulham
    - Islington
    - Kensington and Chelsea
    - Lambeth
    - Lewisham
    - Southwark
    - Tower Hamlets
    - Wandsworth
    - Westminster
    - City of London
	- Outer London
    - Barking and Dagenham
    - Barnet
    - Bexley
    - Brent
    - Bromley
    - Croydon
    - Ealing
    - Enfield
    - Haringey
    - Harrow
    - Havering
    - Hillingdon
    - Hounslow
    - Kingston upon Thames
    - Merton
    - Newham
    - Redbridge
    - Richmond upon Thames
    - Sutton
    - Waltham Forest

This repository aims to collect boundary polygons for such cities.

Currently it contains administrative data for:

- New York City
- London
- Tokyo
