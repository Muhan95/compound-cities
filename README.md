# Compound Cities

While *compound city* isn't a proper geographic term, it is a fitting description for large cities with multipe well-defined and sometimes semi-autonomous administrative sub-divisions.  For example New York is composed of 5 *Boroughs*, and Tokyo is a vast conglomerate of 23 *Special Wards*.  It is often hard to find machine-readable data on the boundaries of these sub-divisions, and rarely are such data ever organized to highlight the logical hierarchy of the areas.  This repository aims to collect boundary polygons for such compound cities.  Currently it contains administrative boundary geoJSON data for:
